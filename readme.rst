Questions

Dead ends

This is a set of questions that I asked myself and had no meaningful answer to.

#. What toolset to retrieve from this site? http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORWINDOWS.aspx
#. Is it 8-bit or 32-bit?
#. Which Atmel Studio template to use (see this list http://start.atmel.com/#project)?
